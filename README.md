# AWKYDO
AWKYDO will keep your Desktop organized!

AWKYDO is a handy tool that helps you manage the mess of items on your desktop.

You can group Icons together, align these groups on your screen and stash all files into a folder automatically when you shutdown your computer.

This project is in early dev and I'm still learning to work with the Windows API, so don't expect it to work at the moment.
